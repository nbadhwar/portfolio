                                <p>As the fifth largest school district in Michigan, Plymouth Canton Community Schools (PCCS) provides high quality education to a large community of students. In doing so, the district utilizes a variety of communication methods and mediums in order to deliver information to its community. </p>
                                <p> PCCS partnered with the University of Michigan for a full analysis of how successfully their digital outlets engage the various stakeholders within the elementary school district.  </p>

                                <p>To begin our project, our team worked together to analyze different aspects of our client and problem to better understand the problem. This included four areas of research:</p>

                                    <ol>

                                        <li> Background research on Plymouth Canton Community School District and an in depth analysis of the current platforms in use</li>
                                        <li> Research on the importance of communication methods</li>
                                        <li> Research on the importance of parent involvement in childhood education</li>

                                        <li> Other school districts utilized their social media and school websites in a very different way than PCCS. More research was necessary to understand the effectiveness of differences.</li>
                                        <li> PCCS had adapted a model where every piece of information was displayed on every communication outlet, whether it was social media or emails </li>
                                        <li> In order to create a transparent environment with community involvement, adequate communication devices are essential to facilitate these interactions </li>
                                        <li> Children with parental involvement in their academic lives correlates with student-academic success</li>

                                <p> Based on our background research we identified 3 types of stakeholders we wanted to interview.</p>
                                <h5>Our interview participants and overarching research questions were as follows:</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <span id = "listTitle" > 2 Parents: </span> What platforms do parents prefer and what creates preference for a particular platform? </li>
                                    <li> <span id = "listTitle" > 2 Teachers: </span> What are the primary methods of communication used to interact with parents and students, and why are these methods preferred over others?
                                    </li>
                                    <li> <span id = "listTitle" > 2 Board Members: </span> How has the community changed or adapted over time in relation to its digital platform use?</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Interviews were conducted via Zoom and were around 45-60 minutes in duration. During each interview, participants were encouraged to elaborate on their statements, and express their honest opinions. Two members of our team were in each interview with one leading and asking questions and the other taking detailed notes that were used for later analysis. Qualitative data from each interview was then consolidated into an Affinity Diagram which was used to organize information and uncover common trends identified by stakeholders.</p>

                                    <li>Interview notes, recordings, and transcripts were reread and rewatched to derive sets of qualitative data - each set consisting of poignant statements said by the respective participant.</li>
                                    <li>Each set of data per participant was added to a master sheet through Miro - an online visual collaboration tool (essentially a virtual whiteboard). Statements were grouped according to their similarities</li>
                                    <li>The groups were then organized according to a “tree-like” hierarchy and at each level, were given a description outlining the sentiment and general focus of sub-group</li>
                                    <li>The top-tier descriptions were then used to derive our primary findings.</li>

                                <h3>Findings</h3>
                                <p>After analyzing our interview data we discovered the following findings:</p>
                                <h4 id="findings">1. Emails are a common and popular form of communication, but the popularity of the platform leads to high volume of emails and some filtering and organizational issues.</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The popularity of emails leads to an overwhelming amount of emails being sent both privately and publicly </li>
                                    <li>Ambiguity around who to email for specific questions and concerns</li>
                                    <li>Stakeholders had a difficult time filtering through the mass of emails sent out by the district</li>
                                    <li>Email allows for little categorization of messages </li>
                                </ul>
                                <h4 id="findings">2. Since the website is broadly used by the entire district, schools have successfully utilized targeted communication to relay important information.</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>With PCCS being such a large and expansive school district, different groups have been forced to compete for real estate on the primary website. Many schools have found ways to get around this issue by utilizing targeted information campaigns that cater to specific groups and information interests</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h4 id="findings">3. The website has a few organizational issues that make it hard to navigate.</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>There is a large amount of information embedded throughout the site that requires a general idea of where to find specific information </li>
                                    <li>Throughout various interviews, users stated the website is “clunky” and “cluttered”</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h4 id="findings">4. Social media is a far-reaching platform that parents turn to for information but can be unprofessional and unreliable.</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Due to their convictions and familiarity, social media platforms are highly utilized by parents</li>
                                    <li>Multiple stakeholders mentioned that the Facebook page is underutilized due to the absence of constructive two-way engagement and lack of professionalism</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>

                                <h3>Recommendations</h3>
                                <h4 id="findings"> 1. Address over-communication through more targeted communication and narrowing the scope of communication lists. </h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Our suggestion to improve the email list feature would be to narrow the scope of potential lists and transition to increasingly specific lists. Also, limiting the volume of emails sent by each subscription would help to avoid spam-like communications</li>
                                    <li>To help resolve the issue of over-communication, we suggest surveying a random sample of parents and inquiring about their preferred method of communication for different types of information</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h4 id="findings"> 2. Q&A Forum.</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> This forum would best be implemented on a lower level, potentially on a school-by-school basis, and could exist on a platform similar to Reddit </li>
                                    <il>Creating a Q&A forum dedicated to answering questions and concerns from stakeholders would highly increase the amount of two-way communication</il>
                                </ul>
                                <h4 id="findings"> 3. Change the content of social media posts OR increase content regulation.</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>We have found through research and competitive analysis that social media is a powerful tool which generally works well for school districts. Adopting techniques similar to other districts like customizing social media posts and eliminating reusing posts will be helpful in increasing positive engagement and facilitate more positive and constructive two-way communication </li>
                                    <li> Having someone act as a moderator on social media to quickly address questions and concerns and take down any negative or unnecessary comments as they come up may help parents feel more comfortable participating in online discussions</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h4 id="findings"> 4. Consider a reorganization of the website OR develop school-related websites. </h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Through our research we’ve realized that parents and administrators prefer content to be organized according to user-flow.</li>
                                    <li>We suggest conducting more user research through surveying and interviews and developing user personas and user experience maps to better understand how, when, and why stakeholders currently engage with the website and how it can be restructured to improve its navigation and organization</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h4 id="findings"> </h4>

                                <p>This project allowed us an in-depth look at PCCS communication outlets. Throughout the course of a semester we were able to interview 6 participants to better understand the communication needs of various stakeholders. Throughout the process we were limited by both time and the contact of stakeholders available to us.  </p>

                                <p>We started off our semester creating an Interaction Map. The goal of this assignment was to generate a static representation of the library's website in order to evaluate all of the actions and possible states. Throughout the process we were able to highlight areas for future tests and evaluations. Additionally, we were able to get a better understanding of the site and noticed many areas of repeated information.</p>

                                <p>Conducting surveys was an important process in order to gain a broad understanding of the NPL website's current or potential users in order to learn about their needs, attitudes, characteristics, and current practices.

                                <p>According to our client, the mailing list goes out to approximately 27,000 users, with an opening rate of about 20%.

                                    <li>Throughout the site there is very little help or documentation </li>
                                    <li>There exists areas for breadcrumbs allowing users to see how they have accessed a specific page, but the links do not work consistently throughout the site</li>

                                <p>We recruited 4 individuals who had experience using a library website in the past, but had not used the Normal Public Library website. This blind set up allowed for users who had some idea what they were doing, but provided us with unbiased opinions and clear first impressions on the website.</p>
                                <p>In order to present our users with tasks, we created various scenarios for the users to follow along with. We watched as they completed each task, taking notes of how each user navigated the site and how successfully they were able to complete each task. </p>

                                <p>Each evaluation was delivered to NPL in the form of a report with information on the methodology, findings, and recommendations.

                                    <li>Create and highlight documentation for users to guide them through common website tasks.</li>
                                    <li>Remove features such as "chat with a librarian" that are not currently available to users or highlight hours of operation.</li>
                                    <li>Add links to related webpages or group similar information together in a more concise way to allow users access it easily.  </li>
                                    <li>Ensure that all links listed on the website work.</li>
                                    <li>Consider changing the layout of the website to include goal-oriented headings or a more intuitive search bar.</li>
                                    <li>Consider reorganizing information within webpages to make it easier to read and more consistent</li>
                                    <li>Consider replacing the quicklinks on the homepage with more common tasks.</li>
                                    <li>Create a recommendation section on the homepage to aid users who are browsing for materials.</li>

                                MeatFreed is a startup based in the United Kingdom that promotes restaurants and businesses that endorse and sell vegan products. MeatFreed has a mobile app that provides offers and blog posts to their end-users for vegan restaurants, promoting vegan products and local businesses at the same time.

                                <p>MeatFreed's business partners lack the visibility to view data on the various posts and offers they provide to end-users through the mobile application that prevents them from connecting and interacting with their customers. </p>

                                    Our client required a web dashboard that would allow their business partners to view relevant data to understand the impact MeatFreed is having on connecting their business and products to end-users.

                                <p> In order to kick things off, our team began by researching the restaurant industry and various analytic dashboards in order to get a better understanding of what our design should encompass. Our competitive analysis notes can be seen <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p5r0Ftit_RkiWbvrE3yFa77E6b3btCffg5LjEKVV-bs/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a> </p>

                                <br>

                                <p>During initial research, our team also adopted an agile development environment where we had weekly sprint ceremonies including product backlog grooming sessions, backlog refinement, daily stand-ups, and retros in order to iteratively create designs and develop code. Our trello board containing our backlog can be seen below.  </p>

                                <br>

                                <p>Our team members rotated through roles of scrum master, product owner, developer, designer, and database engineer in order to complete this project. Every week we assigned a new scrum master and product owner to take on the following weeks tasks where we would groom through our backlog, assign points to stories, pick up various tickets, and make sure the team was on track without any blockers to their tickets. Our design tickets ran a week earlier than their corresponding development tickets to allow for feedback, iterations, and approval from our client. Once approved, the corresponding database and React changes were made to incorporate the wireframes.</p>

                                <p>Interviews were conducted via Zoom and were around 45-60 minutes in duration. During each interview, participants were encouraged to elaborate on their statements, and express their honest opinions. Two members of our team were in each interview with one leading and asking questions and the other taking detailed notes that were used for later analysis. Qualitative data from each interview was then consolidated into an Affinity Diagram which was used to organize information and uncover common trends identified by stakeholders.</p>

                                    <li>With PCCS being such a large and expansive school district, different groups have been forced to compete for real estate on the primary website.

                                <h4 id="findings"> 1. Address over-communication through more targeted communication and narrowing the scope of communication lists. </h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Our suggestion to improve the email list feature would be to narrow the scope of potential lists and transition to increasingly specific lists. Also, limiting the volume of emails sent by each subscription would help to avoid spam-like communications</li>
                                    <li>To help resolve the issue of over-communication, we suggest surveying a random sample of parents and inquiring about their preferred method of communication for different types of information</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h4 id="findings"> 2. Q&A Forum.</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> This forum would best be implemented on a lower level, potentially on a school-by-school basis, and could exist on a platform similar to Reddit </li>
                                    <il>Creating a Q&A forum dedicated to answering questions and concerns from stakeholders would highly increase the amount of two-way communication</il>
                                </ul>
                                <h4 id="findings"> 3. Change the content of social media posts OR increase content regulation.</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>We have found through research and competitive analysis that social media is a powerful tool which generally works well for school districts. Adopting techniques similar to other districts like customizing social media posts and eliminating reusing posts will be helpful in increasing positive engagement and facilitate more positive and constructive two-way communication </li>
                                    <li> Having someone act as a moderator on social media to quickly address questions and concerns and take down any negative or unnecessary comments as they come up may help parents feel more comfortable participating in online discussions</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>Through our research we’ve realized that parents and administrators prefer content to be organized according to user-flow.</li>
                                    <li>We suggest conducting more user research through surveying and interviews and developing user personas and user experience maps to better understand how, when, and why stakeholders currently engage with the website and how it can be restructured to improve its navigation and organization</li>

                                <p>This project allowed us an in-depth look at PCCS communication outlets. Throughout the course of a semester we were able to interview 6 participants to better understand the communication needs of various stakeholders. Throughout the process we were limited by both time and the contact of stakeholders available to us.  </p>

                                <p>The 2021 ACM CHI Virtual Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems is the premier international conference on Human-Computer Interaction. CHI – pronounced ‘kai’ – is a place where researchers and practitioners gather from across the world to discuss the latest in interactive technology. CHI is generally considered the most prestigious in the field of HCI and attracts thousands of international attendees annually.

                                <p>I joined a group of 3 other students at the University of Michigan School of Information to complete in the CHI 2021 Student Game Design Competition. Our team chose the follow category that eventually inspired us to create Strescape: an app that teaches students how to manage stress.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Transformative & Transgressive Play: This category attends to the expanding boundaries of play and game design with the emergence of independent games, art games, and political games as well as gamified/playbourised systems that explore the role of play in non-gaming settings. For example, games now play an increasingly important role in areas like education, healthcare, safety, urban planning, sustainability, and other economic, cultural, and societal sectors. Games submitted to this category should draw on these expanding boundaries of game design to create innovative gameplay for non-gaming settings, and critically reflect on challenges.</li>

                                High school is a formative time in which adolescents navigate many changes that can affect their mental health. Many high school students lack the necessary physiological and psychological resources to efficiently cope with stress. As uncontrolled or chronic stress can quickly become a mental and physical health issue, it is important to provide adolescents with the resources to learn how to deal with negative thoughts and emotions. In order to provide a resource that combats this issue, we created Strescape, a mobile application that allows students the resources to escape their reality while developing healthy life-long coping mechanisms. We describe in detail our research and inspiration for the app as well as detailed game play and design aspects.

                                <h3>Our Solution:</h3>
                                <p>We created an app called Strescape with a target audience of high school students. The app teaches students about mindfulness habits while users navigate through a virtual escape room. Each escape room follow a specific theme that encourages relaxation such as a gardening theme.  </p>
